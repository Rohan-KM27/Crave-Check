       - Return 'YES' if the product is a consumable food, 'NO' otherwise.
    
    2. Extract the ingredients/components from the label.
       - List each ingredient or component under a list named 'ingredients_list'.
    
    3. Extract the nutrition value if present.
       - List the nutritional values (e.g., calories, fats, proteins, carbohydrates) and return them as a dictionary
         with the following format: ('Nutrient': 'Amount').
       - Example: ('Calories': '200 kcal', 'Fats': '10g', 'Proteins': '5g', 'Carbohydrates': '30g').
    
    4. For each ingredient or component, generate a detailed description of its effects on health.

    6. Ignore any irrelevant or decorative text present on the label.
    7. Ensure the components are correctly matched with both their nutrition and health-related details.
